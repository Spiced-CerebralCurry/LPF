the Code.c file runs the operations with help of reading form the DUE.txt file 
it has the due bill indexed based on the customerID 
the calculated the new total bill 
and prints it into the file that we will genrate at the end by providing a suitable name (and file type (prefrably .txt))
thats all 
thanks for reading :)
